<h1>Education Indicators Analysis<h1>
<h2>Overview<h2>
This repository hosts an analysis of global education indicators, utilizing a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The primary objective of this project is to explore the intricate relationships between various educational metrics, such as literacy rates, government expenditure on education, pupil-teacher ratios, and school enrollment rates, to understand their impact on educational outcomes across different countries.

<h2>Project Goal<h2>
The main goal of this analysis is to determine which factors most significantly influence adult literacy rates worldwide. We investigate the interplay between government investment in education, classroom dynamics (pupil-teacher ratios), and access to schooling (enrollment rates) to identify key drivers of literacy.

<h2>Dataset<h2>
The dataset used for this analysis is obtained from Kaggle. It comprises a wide range of education indicators for various countries, including:

- Literacy rates (adult, youth, male, female)

- Government expenditure on education (as a % of GDP, per student)

- Pupil-teacher ratios (primary, secondary, tertiary)

- Enrollment rates (primary, secondary, tertiary)

- Other relevant demographic and economic indicators


<h2>Analysis Insights<h2>
Our analysis revealed several key findings regarding the factors influencing literacy rates:

- Government Expenditure on Education: There is a moderate positive correlation between government expenditure on education and literacy rates. However, its influence appears less pronounced when compared to other critical factors.

- Pupil-Teacher Ratios: A strong negative correlation was observed between pupil-teacher ratios and literacy rates, particularly at the primary education level. This suggests that smaller class sizes and more individualized attention (lower ratios) are significantly associated with improved literacy outcomes.

- School Enrollment Rates: School enrollment rates, especially at the secondary level, exhibit a strong positive correlation with literacy. Higher enrollment indicates broader access to education, which directly contributes to higher literacy rates.
